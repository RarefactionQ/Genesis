# Genesis

Genesis is a space breeding simulator. It's about making hard choices and killing babies if they aren't useful.

This is written in Python, so you'll need Python.
I use [blessings](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/blessings) to make text pretty.

To install:

~ pip install blessings

~ git clone git@github.com:RarefactionQ/Genesis.git

~ cd Genesis

~ python Genesis.py
